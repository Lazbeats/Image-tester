Used TensorFlow with Keras to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for food image classification across five categories,
leveraging data preprocessing, augmentation, and training on resized datasets to accomplish accurate categorization of unseen test images, resulting in 98% test accuracy with visual insights from classification reports,
confusion matrices, and training loss graphs.
